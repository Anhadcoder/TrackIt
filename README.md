# TrackIT

A simple Git-like version control system for tracking a **single file**, built in Go.

---

## Overview

TrackIT is a lightweight, command-line file tracker inspired by Git. It supports fundamental version control operations like initializing a tracker, committing changes, managing branches, viewing logs, stashing, reverting commits, and diffing files â€” all for a **single file** in a directory.

It is designed to demonstrate the core concepts of version control systems, with a focus on ease of use and performance for individual file tracking.
